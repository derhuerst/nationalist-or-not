# Nationalist or not

A small tinder like game in which one tries to judge if people are members of a nationalist party based on their pictures.

This is a showcase for what cool things one can build with wikidata.

To run locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:k-nut/nationalist-or-not.git
cd ./nationalist-or-not
yarn install # or npm install
npm start
```

This will start server on port 8080:

```bash
open http://localhost:8080/
```

To build a bundled version to `dist` (which can be deployed):

```bash
npm build
```
